              <p>
                Our transactional attorneys live and breathe business and have experienced the lifecycles of numerous businesses, which enables them to provide legal counsel and documents that are precise and relevant.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have hired business attorneys before then you are probably well aware that not all lawyers are equally suited for a task, and it is also very hard to tell a very good lawyer from a mediocre lawyer until litigation occurs and opposing counsel points out all of the flaws in a contract or business strategy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our business lawyers strive for excellence in thought, strategy and product, and we think you will notice a difference. Our law firm also strives to have transparent and affordable billing practices so that businesses can preserve as much capital as possible to grow and succeed.

            Business law is the law that governs what happens with commercial matters, and there are two main types: regulation of commercial entities and regulation of commercial transactions. Laws have evolved over centuries, and have had to adapt to changes in technology and society.

                    The attorneys that practice in our law firm's securities law practice group advise clients on securities issues and assist with preparing private placement memoranda and related private offering materials. Our law firmâ€™s approach is to thoroughly understand a client's business and future objectives so that our securities lawyers can better advise each client as well as to help ensure that any disclosure documents are accurate and complete.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  At our law firm, the securities attorneys understand that there is a difference between simply assisting a client with drafting offering and disclosure documents and helping to guide the business owners and other key individuals to opportunities and relationships that can help them to achieve their goals; thus our attorneys are able to leverage their knowledge and contacts to identify people and businesses that can help clients to grow their businesses and expand their interests.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Although the principal focus of private offerings of securities is often compliance with, or meeting requirement for exemptions from, federal and state securities laws, securities laws are applicable in many other business transactions as well, including mergers and acquisitions and the formation of new ventures, including but not limited to corporations (S and C varieties), limited liability companies, limited and general partnerships, and joint ventures.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span>Public Offerings</span> . We represent public companies and companies seeking to access public markets in initial public offerings (IPOs). When representing issuers, we typically become involved in all aspects of corporate and business planning and structuring so as to most effectively and efficiently provide the result that our clients are seeking.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span>Private Offerings</span> . Some of our clients are active issuers of securities in private transactions which are commonly known as Regulation D 504, 505, or 506 offerings, or Regulation S offerings. Relating to these services, our attorneys also render advice regarding exemptions from federal and state securities registration laws and related regulatory matters. As is the case with public offerings, we also represent issuers, placement agents, and investors in private (exempt) transactions.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 <span>Transactions </span> . The lawyers in our law firm's securities law practice group also perform a wide range of complex corporate transactions including mergers and acquisitions. As you would suspect, these lawyers apply their knowledge of securities laws and financing trends to assist clients in consummating these often difficult transactions in an innovative, cost-effective, and timely manner.

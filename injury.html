            <div class="car_service">
              <p>
                Were you recently injured in a car accident?
                <br />
                <br />
                Because of the number of daily drivers in most cities, being
                involved in or hearing about car accidents has become a very
                usual occurrence in most people’s lives. Many times after a
                small accident, the involved parties trade insurance information
                and allow their insurance agents to deal with setting out the
                particulars of who gets to pay for what and how. However, if the
                damages sustained were significant in any way then you would be
                well-advised to hire an injury attorney who can pursue a lawsuit
                if necessary.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hiring personal injury lawyers can guarantee that you get the
                compensation that you are entitled to after an accident.
                Oftentimes people who are injured in an accident focus on the
                damage to their vehicle and a portion of the medical costs.
                Damages, however, can include, but are not limited to the
                following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Earnings lost due to the accident</li>
                <li>
                  Medical costs associated with any treatment necessary to allow
                  for recovery
                </li>
                <li>Damaged property</li>
                <li>Permanent disability</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Any time you are seriously hurt in an accident, you may be
                entitled to compensation for the time where you were incapable
                of working in your regular occupation. Additionally, the party
                at fault is generally liable for paying for all medical expenses
                and damaged property sustained from the car accident. Medical
                expenses can last a lifetime though so calculating what your
                “damages” are can become extremely complicated. Calculating such
                damages is one of the duties of the injury lawyer hired by the
                injured party. Left alone, a victim may not accurately calculate
                damages and end up with a lot less than he or she deserves.
                <br />
                ​ Don’t Trust Any Insurance Agency or Company.​ Insurance
                companies and business are never, ever, on your side during a
                negotiation over an injury case, including those cases
                associated with automobile accidents. Though it is their
                obligation to ensure you are appropriately compensated, an
                insurance company will attempt to settle with you by paying as
                little as possible. This desire to pay as little as possible
                can, and often does, extend to your own insurance company. So,
                sometimes the injury lawyer hired to handle your case has to
                fight both your insurance company and the insurance company of
                the other party.

              <p>
                Deadly Motorcycle Accidents Are Steadily Increasing?.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nevada, Utah and Texas have long been known as a place that can
                be deadly for motorcyclists. When you mix the city lifestyle
                with motorcycles sometimes the motorcycle rider ends up losing.
                Whether an accident is caused because of traffic congestion, a
                drunken pedestrian crossing the road, or a driver distracted by
                the sights and sounds of our beautiful region, the motorcyclist
                is most often the one paying the price. Because the injuries
                sustained in motorcycle crashes are often so severe most require
                the assistance of a personal injury lawyer to get fully
                compensated for the accident.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span class="highlight"
                  >Reason Motorcycle Fatalities Are So High.</span
                >
                <br />
                <br />
                Motorists often fail to yield to motorcyclists because they
                simply cannot see them, which is the reason for nearly
                two-thirds of motorbike accidents. When driving, many vehicle
                drivers fail to recognize that a motorcyclist follows the same
                rules of the road as they do but when things go poorly the
                motorcycle doesn’t provide the same kind of protection a car or
                truck will. The injuries, therefore, that result from motorcycle
                accidents, are usually extremely severe and long-lasting.
                <br />
                <br />
                These accidents often begin and end within a few seconds-- but
                the damage and pain caused can last a lifetime. If you are
                looking to get yourself compensated, hiring an injury lawyer
                that knows what it takes to win a case can secure your financial
                future and allow you the time necessary to recover and get back
                to a normal life.

                Trucking Accidents Resulting In Injuries Are on the Rise.
                <br />
                <br />
                With millions of registered “truckers” in the world, truck
                accidents are becoming significantly more common, especially in
                Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and San Antonio. Although the laws
                have changed recently to help to prevent trucking accidents from
                occurring, they are still happening each and every day. The
                result of the increase in truckers and trucking is thousands of
                truck-related accidents each year that are oftentimes much more
                catastrophic than a car accident because of the size and weight
                of semi-trucks. Because this is the case many residents end up
                looking for a personal injury lawyer after an accident with a
                truck occurs.

                <br />
                As you might assume, because more and more products are being
                transported around Utah, trucking accidents have increased
                considerably in the past few years. Many accidents involving
                semi-trucks leave the truck driver at fault due to the fact that
                he or she was:
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Not taking note of the road conditions;</li>
                <li>Too exhausted and overworked;</li>
                <li>Not paying attention to the many blind spots; or</li>
                <li>Hurried to meet a deadline.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                ​ Additionally, mechanical and component defects can also be the
                reason behind why the truck fails and causes an accident. This
                can then leave the manufacturer of the equipment at fault or the
                company that didn’t have the truck correctly inspected prior to
                it beginning the haul. Injury cases associated with trucking can
                be complicated, and often the stakes are a bit higher. Because
                this is the case it is often necessary to hire personal injury
                lawyers to pursue claims.

                Our law firm's premises liability attorneys are here to help!
                <br />
                <br />
                If you or someone that you know was injured while on someone
                else’s property, whether it was commercial or residential
                property, most personal injury lawyers will tell you that you
                might have a “premises” liability case. Lawsuits of this type
                are typically brought if the injuries sustained in the accident
                needed immediate medical attention or were so severe that no
                other option was available to the victim.
                <br />
                <br />
                The most common premises liability case is the typical
                slip-and-fall injury, which is typically due to neglect on the
                shop, business, or homeowner. Nevertheless, a premises liability
                case can be anything from combustion/burn injuries, poisoning,
                insufficient protection, pool mishaps, elevator accidents, and
                assault cases. This list is not exhaustive though so if you have
                been injured on someone else’s property then you probably want
                to seek counsel from an injury lawyer who can properly advise
                you about what claims you might have and how to proceed with
                getting compensation for your accident.
                <br />
                <br />
                While these cases appear simple to win on the surface, they can
                often be quite challenging. A personal injury lawyer
                representing the victim must establish who owns the property, if
                the owner is responsible for the injuries sustained, and if the
                owner was the reason the injury was sustained. To prove these
                three pertinent facts would be laborious for anybody who does
                not understand the laws surrounding this type of case. This is
                why it is so important to get an experienced accident attorney
                to help out with your case.

                Product liability cases result when a faulty product is placed
                in the market and causes injury or death to its consumers. Even
                if only one unit of a certain product was defective even though
                thousands or millions of units were manufactured, and that unit
                causes an injury, the victim may still be eligible to sue the
                manufacturer for the damages associated with the injury.

                If you were recently injured or know someone who was injured or
                killed by a product they were using, that case might fall under
                one of the three general kinds of product liability cases:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Faulty product design</li>

                <li>Faulty product manufacturing</li>

              <p>
                Hiring an injury lawyer that knows how to prosecute a product
                liability case will help you to comprehend how to pursue the
                manufacturer and/or distributor of the product that injured you.
                Malfunctioning product design creates liability for the product
                designer, while faulty production creates liability for the
                company that manufactured the product. If the company knew of
                the defect while still putting it out in the market then that
                case would fall under the “failure to properly warn of a product
                defect” category. Understanding these things and coming up with
                a viable legal strategy to pursue your claims is the job of a
                qualified and competent injury lawyer.

                When you’ve lost a loved one because someone else was acting
                negligently or carelessly, you may be entitled to monetary
                compensation for your loss. Our knowledgeable injury lawyers
                will guide you through the complicated process so you will
                understand who may submit a wrongful death claim, and exactly
                what sorts of damages could apply. These damages include, but
                are not limited to, funeral costs, medical costs, lost wages, or
                various other losses your family has sustained, and are often
                substantial.
                <br />
                <br />
                Although no amount of money can adequately compensate a family
                for the loss of a loved one, the law recognizes the loss and
                strives to provide what it can. By figuring out responsibility
                for the wrongful death, the law offers a method to provide for
                the future of the deceased’s spouse, kids, and various other
                dependents. It is the job of qualified personal injury lawyers
                to make sure that the compensation paid to the family is
                appropriate and as high as possible.

                <br />
                <br />
                As any personal injury attorney will tell you, wrongful death
                cases occur from someone else’s carelessness or negligence that
                results in the death of another. These cases are civil in nature
                rather than criminal and that is why the victims’ families are
                required to hire a personal injury attorney to pursue the
                wrongful death lawsuit. Oftentimes if the negligent party is
                being pursued criminally for the death then it is difficult to
                obtain adequate compensation from them since they will be in
                prison and not have money to pay any claims.
                <br />
                Examples of a few wrongful death situations are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A pedestrian killed crossing a crosswalk or at a red light
                </li>
                <li>Construction-related injuries</li>
                <li>Medical malpractice</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Depending on which state you reside in, you may have up to two
                years to pursue a wrongful death case; however, you will
                certainly want to check with an injury lawyer to make sure your
                claim is still viable or to find out how long you will have to
                decide to pursue a lawsuit. It is always better to pursue your
                case as soon as possible though so that you are not barred by a
                statute of limitations.

                “Slip and fall” is a term used for a personal injury case in
                which a person slips or trips on something and falls, and is
                hurt on someone else’s property. As many injury lawyers will
                tell you, the owner of a piece of property may have an
                obligation to preserve reasonable conditions to permit access
                and if for any reason the conditions were such that there might
                be liability then a victim may have a claim on which to sue the
                owner. Whether the victim is young or old, many types of slip
                and fall injuries may result in permanent injuries and other
                damages and it is the job of each accident lawyer at our law

                <h3>Our real estate and construction lawyers know the industry and its players and can provide cost-effective legal services that keep deals moving forward.</h3>
              <p>
                Real estate transactions come in all shapes and sizes and have different legal needs. Our real estate attorneys strive to provide the right legal services for the transaction and focus on "lean" representation continually. Some transactions require substantial legal work and can be shockingly expensive because of their nature, but that is not the norm and our lawyers are minimalists when it comes to "papering a deal."
                <br>
                <br>
                Construction law is arguable far more nuanced than other areas of real estate law, and unfortunately, construction-related transactions oftentimes are not documented very well. It is fortunate that the construction industry has dedicated significant effort towards the utilization of standard forms and technology, but because each transaction is unique it is still advisable to have an experienced construction law attorney on your side.

We also represent both sellers and purchasers of distressed loans and properties and provide legal expertise in related areas. Our services include but are not limited to: 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Representation of Lenders and Services.</span> We have considerable experience in renegotiating troubled loans, addressing lender liability exposure, strengthening the lender’s position if the borrower ultimately files bankruptcy, and making arrangements for the resumption of loan payments, and/or setting deadlines for disposition or refinancing of the property.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Workouts.</span> A successful workout requires the ability to deal with a wide variety of issues, and we take advantage of the unique wealth of information and expertise possessed by our firm’s colleagues. Our overall approach to workouts is a “business-oriented” one that sensitizes the client to relevant legal issues and tailors the legal response to conform to the client’s business considerations.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Madiba Chambers has experience in all legal aspects of the design and construction process, including construction and design agreements; commercial, residential, and public works projects; and all types of construction claims and dispute resolution. Our attorneys practice in the areas of land development, financing, bankruptcy, land use, zoning, environmental matters, insurance coverage, labor and employment, litigation, and leasing. Our attorneys draw on the expertise of both transactional and litigation attorneys, who have extensive experience in all aspects of the construction process. Our services include but are not limited to:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   <span> Litigation.</span> Our litigation attorneys have handled complex claims and litigation matters involving the various aspects of construction projects. These matters have involved construction defects, soil subsidence, design professional malpractice, contractor-subcontractor disputes, mechanics’ lien and stop notice, and other actions involving construction-related issues. Our litigation attorneys are also knowledgeable about the various alternative dispute resolution tools and are aggressive in recommending and pursuing such alternatives when they are in the best interests of the client.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   <span>Transactional Counseling.</span> Our transactional attorneys develop, negotiate, and prepare construction contracts, architect agreements, engineering and design agreements, professional services agreements, purchase orders, payment and performance bonds, mechanics’ liens, stop notices, notices of completion, consulting agreements, and construction management agreements.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Our goal is to provide time-sensitive, cost-effective legal representation on all types of construction matters. A particular advantage is our use of an interdisciplinary team approach. For example, both litigation and transactional expertise can be applied rapidly to deal with construction and construction-defect problems, in the contracting phase, during construction, and especially during post-completion.
